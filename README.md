## Installation

Recommended (PyPi or Conda):

```bash
pip install UQPyL
```

```bash
conda install UQPyL
```

Alternatively:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smasky/UQPyL.git 
cd UQPyL
pip install .
```

## Quick Start

To use UQPyL, define the problem you want to solve. The problem usually contains three important properties:
1. `func` (the mapping from X to Y)
2. The dimensions of decisions and outputs
3. The bounds of decisions (ub, lb)

### Benchmark Problems

```python
from UQPyL.problems.single_objective import Sphere

problem = Sphere(nInput=10, ub=100, lb=-100)
problem = Sphere(nInput=10, ub=np.ones(10)*100, lb=np.ones(10)*-100)
```

### Practical Problems

Define the evaluation function:

```python
from UQPyL.problems import PracticalProblem

def func(X):
    Y = np.sum(X, axis=1).reshape(-1, 1)
    return Y

problem = PracticalProblem(func=func, nInput=10, nOutput=1, ub=100, lb=-100, name="Sphere")
```

**Note:** The `func` needs to accept a matrix of X and return a matrix of Y, with columns equal to dimensions and rows equal to samples. X and Y should be np.ndarray.

After defining the problem, you can use any methods in UQPyL.

### Sensitivity Analysis

```python
from UQPyL.sensibility import Sobol

sobol = Sobol()  # Instantiate and set hyper-parameters
sobol.analyze(problem)
```

### Optimization

```python
from UQPyL.optimization.single_objective import SCE_UA

sce = SCE_UA()
res = sce.run(problem)
bestDec = res.bestDec
bestObj = res.bestObj
```

### Surrogate Modeling

```python
from UQPyL.DoE import LHS

lhs = LHS(problem)
xTrain = lhs.sample(200, problem.nInput)
yTrain = problem.evaluate(xTrain)

xTest = lhs.sample(50, problem.nInput)
yTest = problem.evaluate(xTest)

from UQPyL.surrogate.rbf import RBF

rbf = RBF()
rbf.fit(xTrain, yTrain)
yPred = rbf.predict(xTest)

from UQPyL.utility.metric import r_square
r2 = r_square(yTest, yPred)
```

For more advanced usage, please refer to the documentation (**#TODO**).
